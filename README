*************************** Beufort_ROMS_ssc_comp ******************************
Thie repo is home to the analysis scripts used for the project about 
the composition of SSC on the Alaskan Beaufort Sea shelf in terms
of riverine sediment, local resuspension, and regional advection.
This repo also contains some of the settings/scripts needed to run 
ROMS.

The associated ROMS input files will be uploaded to a Zenodo and linked 
here later.
